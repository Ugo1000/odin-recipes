    <h1>Coconut Rice</h1>

    <p>
      If you are looking to prepare this delicious meal but donâ€™t know how to do
      it, here is all you need to know about preparing this delicious rice meal.
      What you see is a plate of simple coconut rice, super delicious. The only
      difference between the usual jollof rice and this is the use of coconut
      milk; it changes the taste, aroma and impairs the color slightly. I think
      this comes fourth on my list of delicious rice meals. Right after salad
      sauce, carrot stew, and fried rice.

      </li>
      <li>
