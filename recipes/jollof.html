    <h3 start="1">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Chop the tomatoes, onions, and bell pepper into chunks. Place into a
        blender/food processor together with the ginger, garlic, and scotch
        bonnet pepper. Then blitz into a smooth paste.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place a pot over medium heat, pour in the sunflower oil, and add the
        blended mixture. Stir and allow to sizzle, then place a lid over it,
        reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        After simmering for 20 minutes, remove the lid, then add the spices and
        seasonings (Paprika, thyme, nutmeg, bay leaf, and salt). Stir
        altogether.
      </li>

      <li>
        Also pour in the rice and vegetable or meat stock and stir together.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place a piece of aluminum foil into the pot, covering the entire surface
        of the rice (this will keep the steam in), then place a lid over the
        pot. Cook for 20 minutes on low heat (Stirring occasionally to cook the
        rice evenly and also to prevent it from burning at the bottom).
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove lid, bin the aluminum foil and give the rice a gentle stir, then
        return the lid and cook for another 5 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Now the rice should be ready to serve. Serve hot with your favorite
        sides and enjoy!
